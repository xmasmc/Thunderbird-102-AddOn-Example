# Thunderbird-102-AddOn-Example
Example Thunderbird AddOn which creates two buttons:
- Tool button: shows content of E-Mail
- message button: call batch file with 2 Parameters:
  - from (email address)
  - mail text

For testing the AddOn, you have to copy the batch file to your PC: D:\Sample_call.bat

This example use the new Thunderbird interface with experiments.

Because of the very poor documentation for development of Thunderbird AddOns, I put this example here

For testing you can use Sample_callCMD.xpi
